# UPI Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions within the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) ecosystem. By analyzing transaction data, the goal is to identify patterns and anomalies that are indicative of fraudulent activity. This can help in preventing financial losses and enhancing the security of digital payments.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following files:

- `UPI.py`: [Provide a brief description of what this Python file does. For example: "This script likely contains the machine learning model implementation, training process, and/or data preprocessing steps."]
- `upi.7z`: This is a compressed archive (7z format) containing the dataset of UPI transactions used for training and evaluating the fraud detection model (`UPI.csv`). Due to file size limitations, the dataset has been compressed.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project, `UPI.csv`, is provided in a compressed format (`upi.7z`). You will need to extract this archive to access the CSV file, which includes the following columns:

- `step`: [Brief description of the 'step' column]
- `type`: [Brief description of the 'type' column, e.g., transaction type like 'CASH-IN', 'CASH-OUT', 'TRANSFER', etc.]
- `amount`: [Brief description of the 'amount' column, e.g., transaction amount]
- `nameOrig`: [Brief description of the 'nameOrig' column, e.g., customer initiating the transaction]
- `oldbalanceOrg`: [Brief description of the 'oldbalanceOrg' column, e.g., initial balance of the originating account]
- `newbalanceOrig`: [Brief description of the 'newbalanceOrig' column, e.g., new balance of the originating account after the transaction]
- `nameDest`: [Brief description of the 'nameDest' column, e.g., recipient of the transaction]
- `oldbalanceDest`: [Brief description of the 'oldbalanceDest' column, e.g., initial balance of the recipient account]
- `newbalanceDest`: [Brief description of the 'newbalanceDest' column, e.g., new balance of the recipient account after the transaction]
- `isFraud`: [Brief description of the 'isFraud' column, e.g., a binary label indicating if the transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0)]
- `isFlaggedFraud`: [Brief description of the 'isFlaggedFraud' column]

## Code

The main Python script, `UPI.py`, likely contains the implementation of the machine learning model. You might find code for:

- Data loading and preprocessing (you'll need to include steps to extract the data from `upi.7z`)
- Feature engineering
- Model selection and training
- Model evaluation
- Potentially, functions for making predictions on new data.

## Getting Started

To run this project:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  **Extract the `UPI.csv` file from the `upi.7z` archive.** You will need a program that supports the 7z format (e.g., 7-Zip).
3.  Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn). You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn
    ```
4.  Navigate to the project directory and run the `UPI.py` script:
    ```bash
    python UPI.py
    ```
    [You might want to add more specific instructions here based on how your script is designed to run, especially regarding how it reads the `UPI.csv` file after extraction.]

## Potential Improvements

- Explore different machine learning models for improved accuracy.
- Implement real-time fraud detection capabilities.
- Develop a user interface for interacting with the model.
- Incorporate more features to enhance the model's predictive power.
