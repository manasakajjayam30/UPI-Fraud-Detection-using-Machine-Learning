# UPI-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project employs machine learning to detect fraudulent Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions. By analyzing transaction patterns and features such as type, amount, and account balances, the system trains a classification model to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent activities, enhancing the security of digital payments.
